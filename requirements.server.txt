# TeleChat Server Requirements (Minimal CPU-friendly)
# This file contains only the minimal dependencies for running the API server.
# Suitable for CPU-only deployments and lightweight containerized environments.
#
# Note: For full training and GPU inference capabilities, use requirements.full.txt

# Core API dependencies
fastapi>=0.109.1
uvicorn>=0.17.6
httpx>=0.24.0

# Model inference (CPU-compatible)
transformers>=4.30.0
safetensors>=0.3.1

# Note: PyTorch will be automatically installed as a dependency of transformers.
# For CPU-only deployment, transformers will install the CPU-compatible version.
# For explicit CPU-only PyTorch, you can pre-install with:
# pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Utility dependencies
pyyaml>=6.0
requests>=2.28.0
psutil>=5.9.0
